#DECEN Conceptual Model (A prototype!)

##Aim of the developed smart contract

This project uploaded to Github aims to test the practical applicability of a developed prototype of the DECEN conceptual model. 

Details regarding the developed smart contract can be accessed from OsmanSelvi84/DECEN/chaincodeTranscript/transcript.go. 

The file also contains samples for interaction with the smart contract via the CLI.

##Limitations of smart contracts

This is a prototype and has limitations or aspects that need improvement. Some of them are as follows:
- There is no access control mechanism.
- Because it was designed to return a limited number of records, it was not developed to manage many records with pagination and other features.
